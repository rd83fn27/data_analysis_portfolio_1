# Portfolio 1 - Creating messy data sets

Hello and welcome to part one of my data portfolio.

This is the first of a three part portfolio and contains the method I used to create the messy data sets.

The code produces a pair of data sets that have issues with 
- Duplicate rows
- Missing values
- Data split across two files
- Inactive rows
- Incorrect data types
- Multiple values in single entries and stored as a string

Feel free to browse the code.
