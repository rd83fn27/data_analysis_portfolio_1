# Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio

This portfolio contains three parts
1. Creating messy data
2. Cleaning messy data
3. Analysis of the cleaned data


## Part 1 - Creating messy data sets

Hello and welcome to part one of my data portfolio.

This is the first of a three part portfolio and contains the method I used to create the messy data sets.

The code produces a pair of data sets that have issues with 
- Duplicate rows
- Missing values
- Data split across two files
- Inactive rows
- Incorrect data types
- Multiple values in single entries and stored as a string

Feel free to browse the code.


## Part 2 - Cleaning the messy data sets

This is the second of a three part portfolio and contains the methods I used to clean the messy data sets.

The description here is basic as the code itself has a lot of annotation.

At the end of part two the data sets have been cleaned and merged into a single data set.


## Part 3 - Analysis of the data set

This is the third of a three part portfolio and contains the methods and graphs I use in order to explore the cleaned data set.

The description here is basic as the code itself has a lot of annotation.

At the beginning of part three the aims of the section are listed, and by the end a conclusion is found.
